                              Briefly, the Frescalo algorithm calculates the occurrence probability (OP) 
                              of a species not detected or reported in a focal grid-cell, 
                              based on the frequency of this species in the local neighborhood 
                              (here: 100 grid-cells) of this cell, while accounting for the 
                              ecological similarity of the neighborhood. Ecological similarity of 
                              the neighboring grid-cells was calculated based on a set of 76 variables, 
                              comprising climatic, topographic and edaphic measures. A detailed 
                              description of the specifications for the Frescalo algorithm is
